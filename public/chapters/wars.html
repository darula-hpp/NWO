<h1>Wars</h1>

            <h3>Biological Warfare</h3>
Imagine a virus that is transmitted digitally
think of one that can be sent through a friend request
I mean a real Biological virus
It will take humanity back to stone age
Should this happen, I would have failed my mission
My mission is to help technology progress, uncovering clues that will eventually lead us to know God
<hr>

<h3>The Earth is not yours alone</h3>
Think about it
Say bats are advanced in their revolution
The ones you see here have been punished for their sins
The bats bat against humans
Bet against you that you will create a virus through them
You create a virus through bats
The bats are forgiven for their sins
Your learning is then transferd to bats
You the become slaves of bats
Bats are probably a chance to bring back dinasours
A dinasour came in the form of a bat
Humanity might have been ahead in the Stone age era
But our greed can take us back to stone age
