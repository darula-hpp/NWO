<h1>Wars</h1>

            <h3>Biological Warfare</h3>
Imagine a virus that is transmitted digitally
think of one that can be sent through a friend request
I mean a real Biological virus
It will take humanity back to stone age
Should this happen, I would have failed my mission
My mission is to help technology progress, uncovering clues that will eventually lead us to know God

<h3>The Earth is not yours alone</h3>
Think about it<br>
Say bats are advanced in their revolution<br>
The ones you see here have been punished for their sins<br>
The bats bat against humans<br>
Bet against you that you will create a virus through them<br>
You create a virus through bats<br>
The bats are forgiven for their sins<br>
Your learning is then transferd to bats<br>
You the become slaves of bats<br>
Bats are probably a chance to bring back dinasours<br>
A dinasour came in the form of a bat<br>
Humanity might have been ahead in the Stone age era<br>
But our greed can take us back to stone age<br>
