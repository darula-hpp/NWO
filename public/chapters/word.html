Life is about conditioning the human brain<br>

He/who is ahead in technology rules the world<br>

The intelligence is the early adopters of technology<br>

You can’t keep ahead through copying technology<br>

You can’t trick your mentor<br>

He who open sources technology is your leader<br>

He who open sources technology rules the world<br>

You are not smarter than that who made you great<br>

The best gun is no gun at all<br>

If you don’t know yourself you are your own God<br>

If you don’t know your family they are your God<br>

If you don’t know the people they are your God<br>
