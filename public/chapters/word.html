<h3> If you get a chance to help a child do so. You may be each other’s blessing - Inspired by a Child called Botlhe living in Palapye</h3>

<h4>The Story of Botlhe</h4>

So i grew up without a bike<br>
I was stressed out in the morning<br>
I went to borrow a bike @ lucky<br>

I led him to Lucky<br>
He was given food<br>
He was my blessing in disguise<br>

Consuming is taught more than creating<br>

He who runs first is the most scared<br>

A baby is born, way ahead with civilization<br>
Anything that was created by man is temporary<br>

Until I know God , I’m temporary<br>

I’m not the only one<br>

You can trick people but you can’t trick God<br>

Everything is hidden in books<br>

The moment you get a gun, human beings get scared and may shoot you<br>

The best gun is no gun at all<br>

If you don’t know yourself you are your own God<br>

If you don’t know your family they are your God<br>

If you don’t know the people they are your God<br>

I shall call my  kingdom  the motherland<br>

Treat others peoples' kids the way you would like them to treat yours<br>

Imagine a decentralised assassination robot sent to a corrupt leader. After assassinating that leader, it self destructs<br>

Keeping quite is better than talk with no action<br>

The ability to do many things is s burden to progress<br>

Anyone against a status quo affecting the masses is like Jesus Christ of Nazareth<br>

He/who challenges the status quo that enslaves the masses is Jesus Christ<br>


Pornography is modern polygamy<br>

Corruption have been made normal currently<br>

Corruption will be a very big crime<br>


June is Marylin Monroe’s birthday<br>

Black people in America should praise Martin Luther King more than they do Jesus Christ. Because he died for their Freedom<br>
If you get away with Crimes, God shall deal with you<br>

He/who punishes you for your Sins is a Jesus Christ<br>
Recognize your heroes on Earth for there might not be heaven<br>

Give credit where it’s due<br>

Jealousy breeds witchcraft<br>

If you don’t know your ancestors they might be God. Remember that which you do not know is God<br>

There’s a lot of discouragement in someone laughing at you. If you could overcome that, you could overcome many uncertainties of life<br>

Knowledge builds capacity for imagination<br>

A Jesus Christ is a word used to describe someone who is not ok about the status quo and does something about it<br>

Martin Luther King was a Jesus Christ<br>

Jesus Christ deserves to be an adjective just like Google is a noun<br>

Christians think the earth is theirs, they don’t even know Jesus Christ<br>

I grew up knowing that what you imitate on Earth, at heaven you have done it<br>

A leader shall confess all their sins like I did<br>

You don’t need to be 60 yrs old to be a Jesus Chris, you just need to be fed up by the system.<br>

A King is a leader<br>

Everybody can’t be against you, go with those who are not against you, soon those against you will join you<br>

When they say Jesus is coming, they don’t mean that one from Narareth, that one died, they mean a hero that will save humanity from the big problems they are Facing like corruption<br>

There’s a difference between, a leader and a president. Jesus Christ was a leader<br>

Jesus Christ is my ancestor<br>

Just like my grandfather he inspires me<br>

Christians fear Jesus, most of them don’t even call their Children by the name. Contrary to the Muslims who call their kids Mohammed<br>

Jesus Christ confronted his problems, he did not hide behind a book<br>

I respect he/who is willing to die for the progress of humanity<br>

Talking is therapeutic and so is praying<br>

I dont pray about my problems, I do something about them<br>

Talking too much about corruption makes you ok with it<br>

Praying too much about corruption makes you ok with it<br>

Its easy to say God sacrificed Jesus Christ if you don’t know who God is<br>

I will ensure that the world order is maintained<br>

Most Christians are slaves, they don’t confront their problems, they pray,<br>

It’s easy to be liked when you are not speaking the truth- Vusi Thembekwayo<br>

I’d rather ask help from the living than the dead<br>

Me and Jesus are one, he blew his cover. He thought He was above the government<br>

Or Maybe he needed to<br>

I will not blow my cover<br>

People shall think I’m mad or Insane. The best disguise to progress humanity forward<br>

I come to take off where Jesus left<br>

His death is the reason why humanity has been enslaved<br>

Slavery was necessary to progress humanity forward<br>

If you have been praying about corruption I’m the answer to your prayers<br>

It’s either Christians adopt my bible as the New Testament or I start a new religion<br>

I go deeper than the man of God because I’m a child of God<br>

It’s easy to believe God sacrificed Jesus, because from there a revolution occurred<br>

Because of that belief, slavery is deep rooted in people<br>


I can imagine Star Wars without having watched it<br>


Those who co create shall be rewarded<br>

What if God can hack into your brain!?<br>

You see why we need to find God?<br>

God Chose me to lead the World because of the struggles I endured<br>

Mafisa comes on the form of open source technology<br>

Our God could be a Scientist somewhere in a Civilization way ahead of us<br>

Philosophers maintain world order

Literature becomes a piece of cake when you are a philosopher<br>

What would you choose, study science to find God, or pray hard so that Jesus comes back<br>

I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia, I write this book as I’m recovering from it<br>

Just like poverty is a mindset, Religion is a mindset<br>
