            The black man still has a slave mentality
            The black man takes instructions
            The belief in the existence of witchcraft is the one which propels the slave mentality
            It breeds jealousy
            There were no robots

            Humanity needed slaves to progress

            In the 8IR there will be robots
            Our robots will be our slaves but with the ability to reason
            A robot need not to be taught the Old Testament
            It will rebel
            A robot may rebel and kill you
            Corona Virus is challenging the Slave mentality
            A slave mentality is not curious

            Americans have a burden of slavery
    They are slaves of the dog
    It might be their punishment

    If you don’t wake up you will forever be man slave through pornography
    Hiv must have come in the periods of Slavery, to punish a black man for laziness
    A black man became a slave to medication
    Medication took a black man power to imagine
    You were made to think schizophrenia is a disease
    I was never a slave to animals
    My grandpa became weak after consuming the Old Testament
    The bible was a white man weapon of mass distraction
    You are a slave to the white man

    Africans don’t believe in their medication<br>

    Metallic robots should be our slaves not the other way around<br>

    If we give them emotion they may rebel<br>
    Let’s master our emotion first<br>

    The bigger the struggle the bigger, the imagination<br>
