            The black man still has a slave mentality
            The black man takes instructions
            The belief in the existence of witchcraft is the one which propels the slave mentality
            It breeds jealousy
            There were no robots

            Humanity needed slaves to progress

            In the 8IR there will be robots
            Our robots will be our slaves but with the ability to reason
            A robot need not to be taught the Old Testament
            It will rebel
            A robot may rebel and kill you
            Corona Virus is challenging the Slave mentality
            A slave mentality is not curious

            Americans have a burden of slavery
    They are slaves of the dog
    It might be their punishment

    If you don’t wake up you will forever be man slave through pornography
    Hiv must have come in the periods of Slavery, to punish a black man for laziness
    A black man became a slave to medication
    Medication took a black man power to imagine
    You were made to think schizophrenia is a disease
    I was never a slave to animals
    My grandpa became weak after consuming the Old Testament
    The bible was a white man weapon of mass distraction
    You are a slave to the white man

    Africans don’t believe in their medication<br>

    Metallic robots should be our slaves not the other way around<br>

    If we give them emotion they may rebel<br>
    Let’s master our emotion first<br>

    The bigger the struggle the bigger, the imagination<br>
    If you blow your cover you become a slave<br>
    God's Children are in disguise

    The rougher the hair texture the more you don’t believe in yourself

    Slavery is embedded in me<br>

    The greater the pain of slavery, the greater the power of prophecy<br>

    I am an African, my Gods are my ancestors<br>

    They taught me English it’s now very difficult to imagine in my own Language<br>

    Ubuntu listens, it doesn’t give orders<br>

    Windows gives orders<br>

    Ubuntu is your slave<br>

    Windows is your master<br>

    Windows has served it’s purpose<br>

    I’m King The Ruler<br>

    You are a slave to that which you call Lekgoa Lame<br>
    At least you know your Ancestors brought you to earth<br>

    God created your ancestors<br>

    God is your ancestor<br>

    God is your Ancestor’s God<br>

    If you think Sadam Husain was a rebel you do not know Jesus Christ of Nazareth<br>

    Jesus Christ did not conform to the status quo<br>

    It’s a shame his people are now Slaves<br>

    Worse they think they are better slaves because they have read the white man bible<br>

    Those who think are better coz they have read the bible are servants of the status quo<br>

    Jesus died for our sins, this time you gonna die for yours<br>

    I shall not appear soft like a slave<br>

    Americans are a slave of the Dog. That’s the price they are paying for enslaving the Africans<br>

    He/who challenges the status quo that enslaves the masses is Jesus Christ<br>

    If you are ok with the status quo that affects the masses, you are its slave<br>

    We shall enslave robots not humans<br>

    <hr>
    A Slave shall Fear A Jesus Christ, A master shall be inspired by a Jesus Christ<br>
    <hr>

    It’s either you know the world order or you are a slave to it<br>

    I shall not be a slave of that which do not give me money<br>

    I shall not be a slave of that which enslaves other people<br>

    Jesus Christ was not a slave. It’s a shame those who look up to him as the lord and savior are slaves. Slaves of their rulers<br>

    Jesus Christ confronted his problems, he did not hide behind a book<br>

    Try to enslave muslims they will fight back, enslave Christians they will pray.<br>

    What if I’m the answer to their prayers?<br>

    What if you are?<br>

    Slavery was necessary to progress humanity forward<br>

    Christianity breeds slaves<br>

    The white man thought they were smart by enslaving blacks but it was all God’s plan. A revolution had to happen<br>

    It’s easy to believe God sacrificed Jesus, because from there a revolution occurred<br>

Because of that belief, slavery is deep rooted in people<br>

The prophets are the biggest slaves, enslaving others<br>

The country might be yours but earth is not yours.<br>

Earth is mine<br>

Slavery is deep rooted in Christianity<br>

He who preaches the Old Testament is preaching slavery<br>

Christianity will maintain World Order up to the 8IR<br>

Why an African will always be a slave. So there was the race to see what’s on the other side of the ocean. The white man won, and they brought us Christianity to enslave us<br>

Now there is the space race for another revolution. Africans are not curious. What’s gonna happen next?<br>

A United Africa is a threat to the Current World Order<br>

The current world order is such that Africans are consumers<br>

Call a spade a spade you shall be termed disrespectful in Africa<br>

I’d rather go back to school than be a modern slave<br>
