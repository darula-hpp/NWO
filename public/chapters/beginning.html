<h1>The Beginning</h1>
            
<p>So during the Covid 19, I literally became a mad man. There was a point I even thought of Killing myself. 
    Thank God I recovered. The hallucinations lasted for a week. I even had a car accident where I was seeing 
    Cars and thought the guys are on a race with me Back to Covid-19. I had a vision that the Corona Virus 
    was man made out of someone being greedy. I even came up with a new hierachy contrary to “The father, 
    the son and the Holy Spirit”. It is in the order - You - Your Family - The people - God The text 
    that will follow will clearly reveal what this hierachy means. So I also received some instructions stating that 1. 
    You are not bigger than the Nation 2. You grew up poor 3. You are not bigger than the government 4. 
    Your role is to bring world order 5. You are a leader. In short terms the above instructions clearly shows that 
    I have to be humble in bringing the world order. This book is one of attempts to bring world order</p>

For a new World Order<br>
<ol>
    <li>Its you</li>
    <li>Your Family</li>
    <li>The people</li>
    <li>God</li>
</ol>

Take your time to understand this above hierarchy.<br>
Discover yourself first, share those insecurities . They will help you come out clean to your family first, then that’s when you can lead the people<br>
You knowing that you are smart is enough. Trying to show people you are smart raises competition<br>
The best disguise is being yourself.<br>
You cannot control what you do not know/understand<br>
You cannot lead people if you do not know your family<br>
Your family is your biggest currency, take time to know them<br>
Listen to your parents. If your parents can raise you and kill you, why should the human race exist?<br>
Liberate yourself first, then liberate your family before you can think of liberating other people<br>

Leaders do not compete, they inspire those around them to be better than themselves<br>
You knowing that you are smart is enough. Projecting onto other people creates competition<br>
A leader doesn’t show off how great he is to people. Instead he tries yo inspire people<br>
You are what you feed your brain<br>
He/who is trying to show off how smart they are is actually the dumbest<br>
If my mother can raise me and kill me. Why should human being exist?<br>
If you are opposing an idea because of fear, it’s probably the best idea<br>
Looking at the mirror gives you an impression that you are aging, you will then feed your brain that you are aging<br>
The best decisions are made when your heart is not racing<br>
Avoid making decisions when your heart is racing<br>
Fear breeds self doubt, fight that fear demon in you<br>
That higher power that you do not know is God.<br>
If you tell your brain that the computer is damaging your eyes. Your brain will damage your eyes<br>
Your brain bows down to what you feed it<br>
Take instructions from that, that you don’t fully understand<br>
You are what you feed your brain. Your brain will command any organ from your instructions to it<br>
Fight the self doubt demon. You will overcome many challenges<br>
Your brain acts on what you feed it<br>
He who tries to outsmart people is dumbest<br>
If you are scared, it’s highly likely you are holding onto the right thing to do. Try calm down<br>
Going back to what was eating you is regressive<br>
There’s a difference between poison and the perceived poison. Both can have detrimental results<br>
Tell your family what you do. They may help refine your ideas<br>


I haven’t extensively read the Bible, but I’m rewriting it because it’s God speaking through me<br>
Whatever that is stripped in the New Testament has served it’s purpose<br>
Jesus was victorious in what he did, that brought competition . Small kingdoms rising<br>
You can actually be A God until people find out who you really are<br>
The fact that the Adam & Eve story doesn’t make sense now doesn’t matter.<br>
What matters is it served it’s purpose<br>
That is what God intended<br>
The Social construct is made strong by the story of Adam and Eve<br>
Human Civilization has been thriving off the Social Construct<br>

God Created me<br>
If God sent you, you will serve his Kingdom<br>
If you don’t know the system, you are not bigger than it<br>
You are not bigger than the nation<br>
You are not bigger than the government<br>
Even Jesus was Killed for being a religious rebel<br>

We are all children of God<br>
Remember that which you do not know is God<br>
Trust yourself<br>
Trust your family<br>
Learn how to trust the people<br>
If you think you are not part of the perfect system, you are part of it as a lesson to others<br>
Paul Kagami was sent by God to make Africans believe in themselves<br>
The African problem is deep rooted<br>
I came here to continue on the foundation that Paul Kagami has laid<br>
The World needs a leader and it had to come from Africa<br>
Africa will lead the World through the 8IR<br>
My uncle was sent to help me.<br>
I was then sent to help my brother Thabo Mbedzi<br>
I will soon help all my friends<br>

I come in the form of a psychiatrist<br>
Jesus disciples were early adopters<br>
I will have early adopters too<br>
My disciples will not struggle to understand my teachings<br>
I will prove that God exists
The Old Testament served it’s purpose of making you a follower<br>

This book tries to bring the power of Imagination back to people<br>

Following instructions has served us well and it needs to stop<br>
We need to be leaders<br>

Every animal was sent by God<br>
Adam & Eve story is how the current human race began<br>
Take Note - Current<br>
The One led by The Old Testament<br>
Humanity has a second chance through this book<br>
The story of Saturn turned man against man<br>
Saturn was modeled as a man<br>
Instilling an image in a people that saturn was a man<br>
Saturn was modeled as being black<br>
In black movies Saturn was a Woman<br>
Black people probably know their real enemy<br>
Black people were polygamous because they understand woman<br>
I’m the version of a black Jesus but I don’t go by his name<br>
My name is Olebogeng, It means thank God<br>
Thank God for my existence<br>

I needed to kill myself to come back again<br>

It was a sacrifice for my gf<br>

She over powered me emotionally<br>
