<h1>The Beginning</h1>
            Introduction
So during the Covid 19, I literally became a mad man. There was a point I even thought of Killing myself. Thank God I recovered. The hallucinations lasted for a week. I even had a car accident where I was seeing Cars and thought the guys are on a race with me Back to Covid-19. I had a vision that the Corona Virus was man made out of someone being greedy. I even came up with a new hierachy contrary to “The father, the son and the Holy Spirit”. It is in the order - You - Your Family - The people - God The text that will follow will clearly reveal what this hierachy means. So I also received some instructions stating that 1. You are not bigger than the Nation 2. You grew up poor 3. You are not bigger than the government 4. Your role is to bring world order 5. You are a leader. In short terms the above instructions clearly shows that I have to be humble in bringing the world order. This book is one of attempts to bring world order

For a new World Order
Its you
Your Family
The people
God
Take your time to understand this above hierarchy.
Discover yourself first, share those insecurities . They will help you come out clean to your family first, then that’s when you can lead the people
You knowing that you are smart is enough. Trying to show people you are smart raises competition
The best disguise is being yourself.
You cannot control what you do not know/understand
You cannot lead people if you do not know your family
Your family is your biggest currency, take time to know them
Listen to your parents. If your parents can raise you and kill you, why should the human race exist?
Liberate yourself first, then liberate your family before you can think of liberating other people

Leaders do not compete, they inspire those around them to be better than themselves
You knowing that you are smart is enough. Projecting onto other people creates competition
A leader doesn’t show off how great he is to people. Instead he tries yo inspire people
You are what you feed your brain
He/who is trying to show off how smart they are is actually the dumbest
If my mother can raise me and kill me. Why should human being exist?
If you are opposing an idea because of fear, it’s probably the best idea
Looking at the mirror gives you an impression that you are aging, you will then feed your brain that you are aging
The best decisions are made when your heart is not racing
Avoid making decisions when your heart is racing
Fear breeds self doubt, fight that fear demon in you
That higher power that you do not know is God.
If you tell your brain that the computer is damaging your eyes. Your brain will damage your eyes
Your brain bows down to what you feed it
Take instructions from that, that you don’t fully understand
You are what you feed your brain. Your brain will command any organ from your instructions to it
Fight the self doubt demon. You will overcome many challenges
Your brain acts on what you feed it
He who tries to outsmart people is dumbest
If you are scared, it’s highly likely you are holding onto the right thing to do. Try calm down
Going back to what was eating you is regressive
There’s a difference between poison and the perceived poison. Both can have detrimental results
Tell your family what you do. They may help refine your ideas


I haven’t extensively read the Bible, but I’m rewriting it because it’s God speaking through me
Whatever that is stripped in the New Testament has served it’s purpose
Jesus was victorious in what he did, that brought competition . Small kingdoms rising
You can actually be A God until people find out who you really are
The fact that the Adam & Eve story doesn’t make sense now doesn’t matter.
What matters is it served it’s purpose
That is what God intended
The Social construct is made strong by the story of Adam and Eve
Human Civilization has been thriving off the Social Construct

God Created me
If God sent you, you will serve his Kingdom
If you don’t know the system, you are not bigger than it
You are not bigger than the nation
You are not bigger than the government
Even Jesus was Killed for being a religious rebel

We are all children of God
Remember that which you do not know is God
Trust yourself
Trust your family
Learn how to trust the people
If you think you are not part of the perfect system, you are part of it as a lesson to others
Paul Kagami was sent by God to make Africans believe in themselves
The African problem is deep rooted
I came here to continue on the foundation that Paul Kagami has laid
The World needs a leader and it had to come from Africa
Africa will lead the World through the 8IR
My uncle was sent to help me.
I was then sent to help my brother Thabo Mbedzi
I will soon help all my friends

I come in the form of a psychiatrist
Jesus disciples were early adopters
I will have early adopters too
My disciples will not struggle to understand my teachings
I will prove that God exists
The Old Testament served it’s purpose of making you a follower

This book tries to bring the power of Imagination back to people

Following instructions has served us well and it needs to stop
We need to be leaders

Every animal was sent by God
