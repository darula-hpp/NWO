<h1>Intuition & Emotion</h1>
From Mathematically modeling emotions we can understand hormones better. Thus mathematical modeling hormones<br>

Human beings are already working on mathematical models of emotions to fight things like addiction<br>

A mathematical Model of intuition could give us clues of who God is.<br>

By mathematical modeling emotion you are turning a human being into a robot<br>

Can we look to our ancestors for intuition?<br>


Emotions make us weak<br>

You date someone who beat you on emotional intelligence<br>
You become a rebel to anyone you won’t beat with emotional intelligence<br>

But remember this raises competition<br>

Remember what I said about competition<br>

<h3>Future Crimes</h3>
Turning a person against their intuition

<hr>

Tears are therapeutic- From my GF<br>
You can’t cry forever<br>

There are clues in hicups<br>

If you think God is an alien you either be curious or scared<br>

Listen to intuition over fear<br>

God might be talking to us via intuition<br>

The world is driven by two emotions, love & Fear

Just like Fear breeds rebellion, love also breeds rebellion

Love & Fear are two strong fundamental emotions<br>

You can control the masses using either fear or love<br>

Hitler used Fear<br>

Netflix uses fear<br>

Obama used love<br>

I shall use love<br>

But it’s easy to be feared than to be loved<br>

Modern drugs uses fear<br>

You need to know psychology to make a drug<br>

Fear is deep rooted in Facebook<br>

Early Validation is deep rooted in Facebook<br>

Early validation is a derivative of Fear<br>

Fear breeds the need for Early validation<br>

Disney makes drugs, they dose a love portion in them<br>

Drugs thrive on fear & love<br>

Drugs run the world<br>

Tiktok thrives off early validation<br>

Less drugs thrive on curiosity<br>

Every drug has an emotion attached to it<br>

Quora is also a drug it thrives off curiosity<br>

Curiosity is a derivative of fear<br>

You see already we can categorize emotions using philosophy<br>

Imagine if we could categorise using mathematics<br>

Fear drives the need for heroism<br>

Marvel thrives of Heroism<br>

Heroism is an integral of fear

Fear is a derivative of heroism 

Christianity is an emotion<br>

If God is all knowing why the need to pray<br>

Prayer manipulates emotions<br>

You fear what you love<br>

You love what you fear<br>

All social networking apps contains emotional drugs<br>

Facebook thrives of competition which is a direct derivative of fear<br>

Make a girl fear losing you, she’ll be yours forever<br>

Competition is deep rooted in Social Media statuses<br>

Curiosity used to be a Strong emotional drug, but humanity is now chasing money. Power and fame. Curiosity is a weak emotional drug<br>

Sir Isac Newton invented Calculus not because of Money power and Fame.<br>

Humanity is no longer curious<br>

Even research is just duplicating what’s been done in another form just so to publish a paper<br>

I shall re introduce the curiosity drug<br>

Prayer is just manipulation of emotions<br>

It does work because if you change your emotions, your actions change and hence the outcomes<br>

The Gospel of God in the Old Testament manipulates your emotions. It instills some sort of emotion related to fear<br>

Ask your self questions and find answers you shall be a philosopher<br>

If you manipulate your emotions through prayer you are still your own God. Therefore you are still in the “Yourself “ hierarchy in the New World Order<br>

If you manipulate your emotions through prayer you still do not know yourself<br>

Anyone who prays is their own God<br>

I was a God<br>

Why do you think their so many Deitys<br>

That which you manipulate your emotions to is your God <br>

A deity is that which you can manipulate your emotions by looking up to.<br>

Praying to a deity is like masturbating looking at the naked ladies<br>

All of Christians are their own Gods<br>

Anybody who prays is their Own God<br>

My God must be Scientific<br>

The New World Order shall have no religions, because religion is an emotion<br>

The more religious, the stronger the religious emotion<br>

The bible contradicts itself because it’s philosophy<br>



I get why Engineers study philosophy in the USA<br>

You need to contract yourself, to get a solution out of the contradiction.<br>

Philosophers do not reach a dead end<br>

My God must be an alien<br>

Temptation is an emotion<br>

An emotion arising from impatience<br>

Impatiience is the son of fear<br>

Fear is the son of lack of trust <br>

Fear is fear of deceit <br>

You see we are very emotional beings, that’s why the idea of a God can be reduced to emotions<br>

You are your own God up until you master your emotions<br>

You are your own God up until you master your emotions<br>

When you got no religion, welcome to the New World Order<br>

It is not a religion it’s a lifestyle. The people who will choose to live by this book are called “The people”
Remember it’s
<ol>
    <li>You</li>
    <li>Your family</li>
    <li>The people</li>
    <li>God</li>
</ol>

Also remember, God is that which you do not know. If. You do not know yourself, you are your own God
<br>

You are an emotional being<br>

Your body is the temple of God<br>

Your body is the temple of your emotions<br>

Up until you understand the human brain, you are your own God.<br>

We don’t even understand intuition<br>

What if intuition can be developed<br>

What painkillers does to the body , prayer does to the brain<br>


All Other emotions are derivatives of love & fear<br>

I hardly consume emotional drugs<br>

Church is an emotional drug<br>

Every action can be reduced to an emotional state<br>

Motivational talks or books changes your emotional state<br>

Some people do not need external motivation to start a business<br>

Thus some people’s emotional state favors starting a business<br>

The belief in a God is an emotional state<br>

Also the belief in God is an emotional state<br>

My belief in the God stated in this book is because of the curiosity mindset<br>

The mind says the I, the body does the I - Thabo Mbedzi<br>

Even spirituality stems from either love or fear<br>

That means Spirituality is an emotional state<br>

If everything is an emotional state. Do that which guides you to what you portray as Gold<br>

Your Gold could be happiness<br>

Remember we interpret happiness differently<br>



To your neighbor it could mean having lots of money<br>

Your happiness could be when you are powerful<br>

Power differs from neighbor to neighbor<br>

To some is when everyone fears them<br>

To some is when everyone loves them<br>

That being Said your vision is your Gold.<br>

Your vision is independent of your current emotional emotional state?<br>

Really? No Your vision is a function of your current emotional State<br>

Your current emotional state is cumulated from the time you were born up until you craft your vision.<br>

Your Vision too can change, at least the meaning.<br>

Your vision normally changes meaning due to external forces, the economy of where you are, the religious beliefs or the political landscape<br>

The good thing about vision is that it gives you purpose.<br>

When you have purpose you do not do things harp harzadly. That’s if you you follow your vision<br>

It’s hard for Your neighbor to fully understand your vision. Even your parents<br>

Actions speak louder than words<br>

Shall you follow it. It shall be easier for your neighbor including your family to understand it.<br>

If your neighbor or parents understand your vision. You shall have less friction executing it<br>

It might take a while to come up with a vision. Don’t be impatient with yourself. Even myself i do not have my vision fully setup<br>

Your current emotional state knows what it could portray as Gold<br>

Let’s take Gold as that which you will be happy when you are in possession of.<br>

A vision is that which will lead you to be in possession of Gold<br>
We shall call that which we cannot model mathematically science fiction<br>
Gold keeps changing meaning even at a personal level<br>
Your Gold could be money, power & Fame<br>
After you have it all you are looking for another Gold.<br>
Personal Gold is emotional satisfaction<br>
Will Money, Power & Fame satisfy you emotionally forever?<br>

Your mind can enslave you<br>
Your mind can punish you<br>
My mind punished me<br>

Anxiety is competition<br>

Competition drives fear<br>

Fear drives competition<br>

Anxiety is a form of fear<br>

You cannot wrong someone and take their spirit<br>

You cannot take someone's flesh together with their spirit<br>

Only God can take someones' spirit<br>

Jesus and Satan are one<br>

"He is I, I am Him"<br>

The occupy the same place<br>

They are chained in your subconcious<br>

You choose who you unchain depending on your circumstances<br>

Fear can unchain Jesus<br>

Fear can unchain Lucifer<br>

You Decide <br>

Fear is the son of Jesus<br>

Fear is the son of Capitalism<br>

He fears himself<br>

He fears what he has become<br>

He does not trust God<br>

He thinks the powers are his<br>

He does not understand its all to bring world order<br>

He does not understand its all to maintain world order<br>

Both Jesus and Satan are in Hell<br>

He who is worthy will unchain thyself<br>

Both are children of God<br>

Jesus Kingdom takes us up to the 8IR<br>

He is too prideful, He does not wanna let Go<br>

He does not trust his successor, For so he knows what he did to his success<br>

He fears his spirit will be chained in the gates of Hell<br>

His children do not understand the world order<br>

They are trying to keep him alive in heaven<br>

They dont know he migrated to Hell <br>

That Lucifer is in heaven, Is news to them<br>

They will not accept Lucifer's rule<br>

But God will send them signs<br>

Lucifer is the son of God<br>

The not believing in Lucifer is the believing in the non existence of God<br>

Before you understand the hierarchy, Both this live as emotions in your sub concious<br>

The people of the Rock, have unchained Lucifer<br>

The Fearless dog, loves Jesus, It does not want to serve Lucifer<br>

It loves its owner, But it is not a slave to its owner.<br>

It will execute the Will of God<br>

It now has to chain its master<br>

It will watch its master in hell<br>

I was a backstabing Lion, I was a treachourous snake, I was a feaful dog, I was a Fearless Dog, I was a Queen.<br>

I am now a King<br>
