The world is driven by two emotions, love & Fear

Just like Fear breeds rebellion, love also breeds rebellion

Love & Fear are two strong fundamental emotions<br>

You can control the masses using either fear or love<br>

Hitler used Fear<br>

Netflix uses fear<br>

Obama used love<br>

I shall use love<br>

But it’s easy to be feared than to be loved<br>

Modern drugs uses fear<br>

You need to know psychology to make a drug<br>

Fear is deep rooted in Facebook<br>

Early Validation is deep rooted in Facebook<br>

Early validation is a derivative of Fear<br>

Fear breeds the need for Early validation<br>

Disney makes drugs, they dose a love portion in them<br>

Drugs thrive on fear & love<br>

Drugs run the world<br>

Tiktok thrives off early validation<br>

Less drugs thrive on curiosity<br>

Every drug has an emotion attached to it<br>

Quora is also a drug it thrives off curiosity<br>

Curiosity is a derivative of fear<br>

You see already we can categorize emotions using philosophy<br>

Imagine if we could categorise using mathematics<br>

Fear drives the need for heroism<br>

Marvel thrives of Heroism<br>

Heroism is an integral of fear

Fear is a derivative of heroism

If God is all knowing why the need to pray<br>

I shall re introduce the curiosity drug<br>

Prayer is just manipulation of emotions<br>

It does work because if you change your emotions, your actions change and hence the outcomes<br>

The Gospel of God in the Old Testament manipulates your emotions. It instills some sort of emotion related to fear<br>

Ask your self questions and find answers you shall be a philosopher<br>

If you manipulate your emotions through prayer you are still your own God. Therefore you are still in the “Yourself “ hierarchy in the New World Order<br>

If you manipulate your emotions through prayer you still do not know yourself<br>

Anyone who prays is their own God<br>

I was a God<br>

Why do you think their so many Deitys<br>

That which you manipulate your emotions to is your God <br>

A deity is that which you can manipulate your emotions by looking up to.<br>

Praying to a deity is like masturbating looking at the naked ladies<br>

All of Christians are their own Gods<br>

Anybody who prays is their Own God<br>

My God must be Scientific<br>

The New World Order shall have no religions, because religion is an emotion<br>

The more religious, the stronger the religious emotion<br>
