<h1>Capitalism</h1>
Greediness causes big companies to acquire new innovative ones. Killing some in the process<br>
Money, power and Fame were made to take us up to the 8IR<br>
Racing for money can actually kill you<br>
Money, power and fame have served their purpose<br>
Humans are holding back advancements in currency because of fear<br>
You are made to think a poor man can’t help you<br>

<h3>The real Rat Race</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We compete against each other</li>
<li>We even compete against those who take care of us.</li>
<li>Making an illusion that we care for them</li>
<li>Take other people's solutions to appear smart</li>
<li>Copy ideas to beat your mentor</li>
<li>Give VCast to Facebook, Mark Z has always been my inspiration</li>
<li>Don’t aim to outsmart your mentor, they will not be proud. Be an inspiration instead</li>
<li>You can’t win the rat race</li>
<li>A leader doesn’t care about ideas as long as they are being implemented the best possible way</li>
<li>Competition comes when you View your tweet notifications, you forget why you even posted it</li>
<li>Competition breeds greed</li>
<li>Fear breeds, rebellion and ultimately terror</li>
<li>When i grew up, Mark Zuckerberg inspired me. Money made me want to see him crumble down</li>
<li>Modern terrorism is jealousy</li>
<li>I looked up to my Friend, but found myself competing against him after his words changed my life
Your real competition is yourself</li>
</ul>

You are taught to interpret poverty in materialistic manner<br>
People with more money than me bow down to me<br>
I always chased money<br>
I didn’t know money was hidden in writing<br>
I nearly didn’t write this book<br>
Katlego Keganne inspired me<br>
Watch who you keep around<br>
Your network is your currency<br>
You’ll never go poor mentally with a good network<br>
Mental intelligence will give you all the material things you desire<br>
Get just enough money to solve your problems, too much money will kill you - Drake<br>
