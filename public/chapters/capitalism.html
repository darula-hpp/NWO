<h1>Capitalism</h1>
Greediness causes big companies to acquire new innovative ones. Killing some in the process<br>
Money, power and Fame were made to take us up to the 8IR<br>
Racing for money can actually kill you<br>
Money, power and fame have served their purpose<br>
Humans are holding back advancements in currency because of fear<br>
You are made to think a poor man can’t help you<br>

    <li>We compete against each other</li>
<li>We even compete against those who take care of us.</li>
<li>Making an illusion that we care for them</li>
<li>Take other people's solutions to appear smart</li>
<li>Copy ideas to beat your mentor</li>
<li>Give VCast to Facebook, Mark Z has always been my inspiration</li>

<li>A leader doesn’t care about ideas as long as they are being implemented the best possible way</li>
<li>Competition comes when you View your tweet notifications, you forget why you even posted it</li>
