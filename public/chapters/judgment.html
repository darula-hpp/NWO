<h1>Judgment</h1>
            Don’t judge that which you do not understand. Leave that to God
            My judgement day came
            I’ve been to hell and back
            I was forgiven for my sins
            I have been given a second chance
            I’m serving the Kingdom of God
            Your judgement day will come whenever God feel you should be judged
            After your judgement day, you will fear no death
            In the future there will be a judgement machine that takes you through your sins. You actually judge yourself.
            A person who has been judged by God may appear crazy to you
            If you want to become a prophet, tell people you are a prophet
            I do not judge a man, God will judge them
            God punished Jesus Christ
            Jesus Christ Died for his Sins
            Jesus Christ served his purpose
            Jesus Christ was willing to die for his Sins for the betterment of humanity
            That’s why you are taught he died for your Sins
            He actually made a sacrifice

            Jesus Christ came in the form of me
            God gave me a second chance
            In other words my judgement day passed
            God sent me to be a prophet
            Jesus Christ was judged that’s why he feared no death
            The laws were set up to be part of judgement day
            That’s why you are not bigger than the nation
            The Nation is God’s plan

            I will cause the amendment of some laws which no longer serve us
            If Bushiri was not necessary for the Advancements of Africans, He would have been long punished by God
            After judgement day, you will not fear death, that’s if you have not died
            I was lucky to be punished on earth
I got my life back
Judgement day exists
Only God can judge you
A mad man is in disguise
He is here to cumulate your sins
A black man was punished with hiv/aids
Hiv must have come in the periods of Slavery, to punish a black man for laziness

Hell is on Earth<br>
Judgement day has come<br>
I’m not sure if a third chance exists, but a second chance exist<br>
You are judged by whether you practice what you preach<br>
If your brain tells you something then you do it, you are going to heaven<br>
If your brain tells you something but you are driven by fear or love, you go to hell<br>
Heaven is on earth<br>
Hell is on Earth<br>
