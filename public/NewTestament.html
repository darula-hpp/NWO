    <h3>The New World Order - A preparation for the 8IR</h3>



    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>So during the Covid 19, I literally became a mad man. There was a point I even thought of Killing myself. Thank God I recovered. The hallucinations lasted for a week. I even had a car accident where I was seeing Cars and thought the guys are on a race with me

    Back to Covid-19. I had a vision that the Corona Virus was man made out of someone being greedy. I even came up with a new hierachy contrary to “The father, the son and the Holy Spirit”. It is in the order
    - You
    - Your Family
    - The people
    - God
    The text that will follow will clearly reveal what this hierachy means. So I also received some instructions stating that
    1. You are not bigger than the Nation
    2. You grew up poor
    3. You are not bigger than the government
    4. Your role is to bring world order
    5. You are a leader.
        In short terms the above instructions clearly shows that I have to be humble in bringing the world order. This book is one of attempts to bring world order</p>

        <h3>For a new World Order</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Its you</li>
            <li>Your Family</li>
            <li>The people</li>
            <li>God</li>
        </ol>



        <h4>1. Take your time to understand this above hierarchy.</h4>



        <h4>2. Discover yourself first, share those insecurities . They will help you</h4>

        <h4>Come out clean to your family first, then that’s when you can lead the people</h4>



        <h4>You knowing that you are smart is enough. Trying to show people you are smart raises competition</h4>



        <h4>Fear breeds competition, competition breeds rebellion, rebellion breeds terror</h4>



        <h4>Remember what I said about competing</h4>



        <h4>The best disguise is being yourself.</h4>



        <h4>You cannot control what you do not know/understand</h4>



        <h4>Fear is the root of all evil</h4>



        <h4>You cannot lead ppl if you do not know your family</h4>



        <h4>Your family is your biggest currency, take time to know them</h4>



        <h4>Listen to your parents. If your parents can raise you and kill you, why should the human race exist?</h4>



        <h4>If your heart is racing when you make a decision. Calm it down first. Otherwise your decision will be made from fear, remember what I said about fear.</h4>



        <h4>Liberate yourself first, then liberate your family before you can think of liberating other people</h4>



        <h4>Fear makes you doubt yourself, avoid fear at all costs</h4>



        <h4>Your heart races because of fear.</h4>



        <h4>Leaders do not compete, they inspire those around them to be better than themselves</h4>



        <h4>You knowing that you are smart is enough. Projecting onto other people creates competition</h4>



        <h4>A leader doesn’t show off how great he is to people. Instead he tries yo inspire people</h4>



        <h4>You are what you feed your brain</h4>



        <h4>He/who is trying to show off how smart they are is actually the dumbest</h4>



        <h4>If my mother can raise me and kill me. Why should human being exist?</h4>



        <h4>If you are opposing an idea because of fear, it’s probably the best idea</h4>



        <h4>Looking at the mirror gives you an impression that you are aging, you will then feed your brain that you are aging</h4>



        <h4>The best decisions are made when your heart is not racing</h4>



        <h4>Avoid making decisions when your heart is racing</h4>



        <h4>Fear breeds self doubt, fight that fear demon in you</h4>



        <h4>That higher power that you do not know is God.</h4>



        <h4>If you tell your brain that the computer is damaging your eyes. Your brain will damage your eyes</h4>



        <h4>Your brain bows down to what you feed it</h4>



        <h4>Take instructions from that, that you don’t fully understand</h4>



        <h4>Don’t conclude without asking, you will feed your brain fear that is unjustified. Remember what i said about fear</h4>



        <h4>You are what you feed your brain. Your brain will command any organ from your instructions to it</h4>



        <h4>Fight the self doubt demon. You will overcome many challenges</h4>



        <h4>Your brain acts on what you feed it</h4>



        <h4>He who tries to outsmart people is dumbest</h4>



        <h4>If you are scared, it’s highly likely you are holding onto the right thing to do. Try calm down</h4>



        <h4>Going back to what was eating you is regressive</h4>



        <h4>There’s a difference between poison and the perceived poison. Both can have detrimental results</h4>



        <h4>Greediness causes big companies to acquire new innovative ones. Killing some in the process</h4>



        <h4>Those who truly care about you do not ask you frequently how your life is going</h4>





        <h4>I cannot punish that which i do not understand</h4>



        <h4>A leader trusts those he/she leads</h4>



        <h4>You are on the same level with those you trying to outsmart</h4>



        <h4>Jesus comes in many forms, he could come through you. You shouldn’t then disappoint the kingdom of God with your actions</h4>



        <h4>Don’t judge that which you do not understand. Leave that to God</h4>



        <h4>If you teach kids what to think. You reduce their level of imagination to yours</h4>



        <h4>Tell your family what you do. They may help refine your ideas</h4>



        <h4>Thinking too much breeds fear & self doubt just do it</h4>



        <h4>Leaders ask themselves the how will people... question instead of the what will people... question</h4>



        <h4>Human beings are fearful creatures. He who shoots first is the most fearful</h4>



        <h4>Crazy is a word you use to describe that which you do not understand</h4>



        <h4>Humans fear what they do not understand</h4>



        <h4>God is a leader</h4>



        <h4>This is a perfect world everything happens for a reason</h4>



        <h4>Human beings fear what they do not understand. That’s why they fear God</h4>



        <h4>You cannot be busy to serve the Kingdom of God</h4>



        <h4>You can even say God is crazy for allowing Killings</h4>



        <h4>There’s life after death</h4>



        <h4>If you dont make time for God, he will not make time for you</h4>



        <h4>Never make decisions when you are too happy or too angry</h4>



        <h4>God is wise</h4>



        <h4>I haven’t extensively read the Bible, but I’m rewriting it because it’s God speaking through me</h4>



        <h4>Whatever that is stripped in the New Testament has served it’s purpose</h4>





        <h4>Jesus was victorious in what he did, that brought competition . Small kingdoms rising</h4>



        <h4>You can actually be A God until people find out who you really are</h4>



        <h4>You don’t die, God takes you</h4>





        <h4>Woman are stronger than man emotionally, that’s why woman lead man From my GF</h4>



        <h4>The fact that the Adam & Eve story doesn’t make sense now doesn’t matter.</h4>



        <h4>What matters is it served it’s purpose</h4>



        <h4>That is what God intended</h4>



        <h4>The Social construct is made strong by the story of Adam and Eve</h4>



        <h4>Human Civilization has been thriving off the Social Construct</h4>



        <h4>Only fear God by doing right</h4>



        <h4>God Created me</h4>



        <h4>If God sent you, you will serve his Kingdom</h4>

        So i grew up without a bike
        I was stressed out in the morning
        I went to borrow a bike @ lucky
        I had met Botlhe before
        I never got to ask who he was at first
        I found out he shares the same name with my brother
        He is actually under privileged like me
        I taught him how to ride a bike
        I led him to Lucky
        He was given food
        He was my blessing in disguise
        Jamisola gave me a medication that & talk therapy that helped calm me down
        My brother probably needs to meet another me to inspire him
        At first I thought my power to imagine would go away
        It actually grew stronger
        Tiro confessed his alcohol ways on that day
        I confessed some of my sins to Innocent Valela & Gomolemo Tau
